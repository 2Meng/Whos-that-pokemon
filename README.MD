# Who's That Pokémon?!

## Description

- We were motivated to build this pokémon knowledge-building game by our love for the universe of POKÉMON. We wanted to use our skills at combining HTML, CSS, JavaScript, APIs, and third-party frameworks to build an engaging and fun game that helps users learn about the thousands of Pokémon out there. We also wanted to give the game a sense of urgency by punishing losing users with a random dad joke. 

- There are a few reasons why we built this project. First, we wanted to synthesize our knowledge base of JavaScript, CSS, HTML, and third-party frameworks such as Tailwind and JQuery. Second, we wanted to explore the usefulness of APIs in bringing useful content to the user. Third, we want to play the game ourselves.

- This quiz helps to solve the problem of pokémon illiteracy. It also uses third party APIs so that we do not have to locally store the large amount of data that makes up Pokémon lore and stats. 

- Creating this game required us to learn how we could use JavaScript to dynamically alter the page. We needed to identify document elements and create logic to determine how they should behave in a given situation. We learned how to use open-source CSS frameworks to make styling easy. Finally, we learned how to access and manipulate needed information out of the vast amount supplied by our chosen APIs.
